delta divise in two majour components 

1: functionnal component
    use entity rec + intent rec to find the task (ex: turn on the light of the kitchen = [action, action, pad, iot, pad, pad, location], intent = turn on light)
    use algo. to find where and what to do the action

2: dialogue component
    use text generation (with context embedding and retrivial db) to generate a personnalised responce

    for question anwering, the use of retrivial db will be the only option

    use bert encoding to encode embeddings of different emotionnal modality and chunk them to the real model (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.04426.pdf)
    feed this embedding to the model attention to hyave a more deep understanding of the behavior of the user


what we can do:
    use smart home
    perform action 
    have a personnalised conversation agent that remember us

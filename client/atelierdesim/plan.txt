Create a new B2B example for artist to use the Imperial Technologies

Goal: get a functionning and running application of the Imperial Technologies


Plan: 

    F2C: 
    - make the payment work (switch to transak) DONE ✔️
    - calculate the partner fee
    - be sure to well calculate total before any transaction
    - connect to credit AMM everywhere it is needed
    - reduce gas fees ==> switch to binance or see on eth mainnet
    - clean the code (remove unnessecary stuff)
    
    Account: 
    - make the currency selection affect the balance getting 
    - make it work for both meta and Imperial
    - change all wallets to work on main chain and creation of nfts 
    - password system work ==> did for meta
    - add eth and usd support
    - clean the code (remove unnessecary stuff)

    Market place:
    - work out designs 
    - clean the code (remove unnessecary stuff)
    - modify the market reader to be allowed to see owner created NFTs

    
    Controls:
    - creating process DONE ✔️
    - update the validation system and creation to cost less fees 
    - be sure the validation and getClient functions works DONE ✔️ ==> need to change in dds for secret key to unlock Did so only the seller can get access to the id
    - listing process working ==> just update to transac + Get an estimate of all fees before listing to see the profit DONE ✔️
    - work on a better looking ui for creating with crypto
    - get the .wait and notifying at every step
    - update dds code and add new did
    - refund process working DONE ✔️ (calculate the fee when buying)
    - no need to add transak support for owner account since he will already have ethereum DONE ✔️
    - get the new tags for painting
    - clean the code (remove unnessecary stuff)
   

    did: 
     - add date of birth to did
     - add bucket for transfer of identity with unlock key in transaction 

New DiD: 
    - goal: store information without it costing crazy DONE ✔️
    - first: encrypt all information and store them as object in localstorage DONE ✔️
    - once unlock, use the private key to decrypt the Did so only the wallet that created the Did can unlock it DONE ✔️
    - update dId everywhere it need DONE ✔️


step 1/3: get listing(easy) + validation(long since remove fees)/refund (remove fees)/proof of sending(test) + get Did bucket working
step 2/3: get F2C running everywhere + AMM + clean server code (moralis update for working with balance, binance, analysis etc) and add balance 
step 3/3: clean and polish all the code and test

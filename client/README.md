The CPL technologies are a collection of decentralized system that allow a better way of making online transactions




## Technologies

We developed a lot of different technologies in order to make our idea work. First of all, we designed a new market system called DDS (Decentralized Delevery System), which allows real world items to be sold as NFTs while being delivered in real life. Second, we built an Account system (DID) that allow user to be a 100% protected and private. Also, we had to develop our own type of NFTs in order to be able to sell real Items as digital ones. Finaly, we created an new type of AMM that we called CPL. This AMM can handle centralized transaction, manage smart contract, lower gas prices (in blockchain communication) and structure pools for the contribution system.
